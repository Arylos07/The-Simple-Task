# The-Simple-Task

The Simple Task was the first digital game ever actually made in an engine and built. The only other piece of software was a Skyrim armour mod known as Legacy of the Dragon King mostly made for personal purposes, and a Dante’s inferno mod that was never finished and cannot be located anymore.

The Simple Task was made for a clanmate known then as SlayTheBordom. At the time, being the commanding officer of that part of the organisation, the game was meant as a challenge that SlayTheBordom could not follow a simple task as getting to the other platform. The Simple Task was a test of my level building skills for creating challenging puzzles that require thought process, skills that would later be used for Don’t Die!. The puzzles in The Simple Task were all references in some form, such as the “surrender” level being a reference to the game we played; SmiteTM. In the game, to vote to surrender the match is done by pressing F6 while not surrendering is F7. The first and main level uses this as there is an invisible bridge that the player can find and the level hints towards (positions of the arches on the bridge and rocks on the platforms) or by giving up and pressing F6 to surrender.

The game was to have a timer later on as well as progression, but after version 3, the project was dropped as there was not much more to work on the game at the time.

The Simple Task was programmed using UE4 Blueprints, a main starting point for me understanding code more effectively for game development. Examples of these can be found below.

The branding of Tactical Gaming (TG) and Ragnarok Games are from old organisations. Tactical Gaming was the organisation I was in when the game was created and Ragnarok Games was the name of Templarius Studios before Templarius was formed officially.

The source available here has a lot of data removed and will require rebuilding of the source. (such as libraries and saved and intermediate content was removed to reduce repository size)

This repository does not include a build of the game.
